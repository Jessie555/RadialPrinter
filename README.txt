This projects is an exploration into the world of Firmware, Design, Control systems, And server control.

The design is a 3d printer that works on a rotating disk. the printer itself wil have two
degrees of freedom : x and z. Using radial transformations, we should be able to use traditional
G-code 

We will be using an arduino mega to run the main operations of the printer, while future plans
are to add a raspberry pi to upload .stl files remotely.
